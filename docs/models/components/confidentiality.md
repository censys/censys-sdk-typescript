# Confidentiality

Refers to the disclosure of sensitive information to authorized and unauthorized users, with the goal being that only authorized users are able to access the target data. Confidentiality has three potential values: High (H) – The attacker has full access to all resources in the impacted system, including highly sensitive information such as encryption keys, Low (L) – The attacker has partial access to information, with no control over what, specifically, they are able to access, None (N) – No data is accessible to unauthorized users as a result of the exploit.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { Confidentiality } from "@censys/platform-sdk/models/components";

let value: Confidentiality = "low";
```

## Values

This is an open enum. Unrecognized values will be captured as the `Unrecognized<string>` branded type.

```typescript
"" | "none" | "low" | "high" | Unrecognized<string>
```
